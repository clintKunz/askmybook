Page 3,"2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts iii STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION’S MESSAGE Dear Educator: The 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts presents a sound framework designed to prepare students for the English Language Arts demands in both college studies and careers. Within this document is a set of challenging content standards for students at each grade level. Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) assessments are based on these standards, and Alabama Achieves: A Strategic Plan for a New Decade defines the accountability measures enacted to ensure student growth. Student success depends on local system leadership, school leadership, and effective classroom instruction. Important local decisions include how students will accomplish these standards, in what sequence teachers will address them, and how much time will be allotted for instruction of each standard. These decisions are as significant as the Course of Study’s indications of what students need to know and be able to do. I encourage each system to use these standards, ALSDE Instructional Supports, and Performance-Level Descriptors to craft local curriculum guides that determine how students will achieve these standards and perhaps go beyond them. These standards are based on a foundation provided by the Revised 2 016 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), Alabama Achieves: A Strategic Plan for a New Decade, Alabama Literacy Act Implementation Guide , the Alabama Dyslexia Resource Guide, and English Language Arts standards in other states. Content standards are designed not only to meet English Language Arts classroom expectations, but also to enhance student performance in other content areas. Eric G.

Page 6,"PREFACE The 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Art s provides the framework for the K-12 study of English Language Arts in Alabama’ s public schools. Content standards in this document are minimum and required ( Code of Alabama , 1975, §16-35-4), fundamental and specific, but not exhaustive. The course of study provides the foundation on which local education agencies can build a robust learning sequence. The standards encourage a broad view of literacy that promotes knowledge-building across categories and subjects, making integration of content and collaboration among educators much easier to achieve. The standards in the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts are a departure from the previous standards. The 2021 standards provide a comprehensive foundation for Kinder garten through Grade 3 literacy , in accordance with the Alabama Literacy Act. The standards set high expectations for student learning in all grades by requiring more attention to foundational reading, explicitly teaching comprehension skills for all text genres, and encouraging the development of advanced reading through increasing levels of complexity in literary and informational texts. When adopting local curriculum, school systems may create additional content standards to reflect local philosophies. School systems should add implementation guidelines, resources, and activities which are beyond the scope of this document. The 2020-2021 Alabama English Language Arts Course of Study Committee and Task Force conducted extensive research during the development of this Course of Study , analyzing the Revised 2016 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts and standards from other states while considering and incorporating guidance from the latest NAEP Reading and Writing Frameworks. Requirements of the Alabama Literacy Act are fully incorporated. Recommendations from the National Council of Teachers of English and articles in professional journals informed the writing of the standards. The Committee and Task Force solicited and responded to public input from interested individuals, ELA experts, and advocacy organizations throughout the state, then incorporated many of their suggestions into the standards. Special Education teachers and administrators, who were selected as members of the Committee and Task Force, collaborated in crafting standards at every grade level. Together the group developed what members believe to be the best Kinder garten through Grade 12 English Language Arts Course of Study for Alabama’ s students. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts vi",447

Page 12,"Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts GENERAL INTRODUCTION The Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts defines what modern learners should know and be able to accomplish after each grade level or course and upon graduation from high school so that they become literate citizens who can enjoy the benefits and meet the responsibilities of citizenship. This document was created by an English Language Arts Course of Study Committee and Task Force consisting of educators from Kindergarten through college, reading specialists, public school administrators, and business and community leaders. For the first time, a task force of special education teachers and administrators met with the other members of the course of study committee to offer advice, perspective, and professional expertise as the group examined the supports which are needed for students with special needs. Mastering the content embodied in the Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts standards empowers students to understand and influence the world around them and prepares them to leverage professional opportunities. The standards guide learners to communicate effectively, develop appreciation for literature, understand diversity in literature and society, and utilize digital resources to function productively in an ever-evolving global community. The standards specify the skills and understandings needed for postsecondary and workforce applications in multiple disciplines. Standards in the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts are categorized into Literacy Foundations, Expression, and Reception, which are adapted from the Reading Framework for the 2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the essential learning established in the Alabama Literacy Act. The Alabama Literacy Act outlines “steps to improve the reading proficiency of public school kindergarten to third grade students and ensures that those students are able to read at or above grade level by the end of the third grade” (Alabama Literacy Act, #2019-523). The act provides the means for learners to develop a strong foundation in literacy and be fully prepared for secondary, postsecondary, and workplace learning. The standards fully support early literacy foundations by defining literacy, fostering an appreciation for literature, encompassing diversity of literature, incorporating digital literacy, and integrating literacy into all content areas. Assessing literacy and providing professional learning for elementary educators, as required in the Alabama Literacy Act, are important supports for the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 1",458
Page 13,"implementation of standards. This intense focus on reading and writing enhances the acquisition and development of knowledge in all subject areas, thus creating well-rounded readers who are fluent with varied types and complexities of texts. The standards encourage a broad view of literacy that promotes knowledge-building across categories and subjects, making integration of content and collaboration among educators much easier to achieve. All standards contained in this document are: ●written in a clear, understandable, and consistent format to be relatable and applicable to learners’ lives; ●organized in ways that are appropriate for their particular grade band; ●designed to include rigorous, focused, and critical content and application of knowledge through high-order skills; ●grounded on sound, evidence-based research; and ●designed to ensure that all students are prepared to succeed in our global economy and society . Standards are written at various levels utilizing criteria from Marzano’s Instructional Framework, the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, and Norman Webb’s Depth of Knowledge (DOK). The standards set high expectations for student learning by requiring substantial attention to foundational reading, mandating comprehension of all kinds of text, and encouraging the development of advanced reading proficiency through increasingly complex texts. Writers of the standards took into consideration the science of reading, which is a body of research on how the brain learns to read that has emerged from multiple disciplines, such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics. These findings provided guidance on the structuring of standards that explicitly define content to support students as they learn to become proficient readers. The Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts includes a set of essential, recurring standards for each grade band, designated as Recurring Standards for English Language Arts. The Recurring Standards represent content that is so integral to English Language Arts that it is emphasized in multiple grade levels. By prescribing that this content be included in more than one grade, the Course of Study affords students an opportunity for deep, rich learning that is scaffolded to meet diverse learning needs. Because content increases in rigor throughout the Course of Study, the recurring standards change from one grade band to the next, reflecting the increasing scope and complexity of the scaffolded content. Effective implementation of the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts requires local education agencies to research and adopt local curriculum addressing the minimum required content found in this document. Local systems may add standards, but no standards may be omitted. Systems should add implementation guides, resources, and activities which are beyond the scope of this 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 2",519

Professional learning is required to ensure that teachers have the opportunity to become familiar with the emphases and standards of the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts . Familiarity with the document will help with the selection of curricular materials and with planning for effective instruction. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 3",101

Page 16,"Alabama Course Of Study: English Language Arts CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK The conceptual framework graphic on the previous page illustrates the goal of the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts, which is to ensure that all students achieve English language literacy. This goal can be accomplished when local education agencies use the logical and comprehensive standards in this Course of Study to select curriculum materials and create the implementation guides needed to deliver effective instruction. Implementation of the Course of Study will encourage students to be lifelong, critical thinkers who can judge the validity of what they hear or read and express ideas effectively. The three concentric circles depict the numerous literacies required of today’s high school graduates. These circles highlight both the components and the foundations of literacy. The dark red Literacy Foundations band around the center indicates the importance of strong foundations needed for all areas of literacy. Literacy Foundations in this Course of Study (Oral Language, Concepts of Print, Phonological Awareness/Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Fluency, V ocabulary, Comprehension, and Writing) are closely aligned with current research on the science of reading. The yellow and orange semi-circles represent the two major components of literacy needed for effective communication -- reception (the process of receiving information) and expression (the process of producing information). The outer circle breaks down these major categories to depict the methods of receiving and producing information -- listening, reading, speaking, and writing, the four basic components of communication and the facets of English Language Arts listed in the Code of Alabama. Communication is at the heart of literacy; the reception and expression of thoughts and concepts, coupled with their integral mental and physical processes, enable the formation and exchange of ideas. All students, regardless of their abilities, can participate in this exchange. Reading and listening, shown in the graphic in shades of blue, are paired with reception. Reading incorporates literacy foundations and skills for interpreting and analyzing written materials. Listening is not merely hearing others share ideas; it involves the active listening and responding which are necessary for collaboration and comprehension in various academic and non-academic contexts. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 5",442
Page 17,"Writing and speaking, in shades of green, are aligned with expression. Writing begins at a foundational level, with the mechanical skills of letter formation and handwriting, and includes skills necessary to spell (encode) words, and then evolves into composing texts in multiple genres and formats, conducting research, and documenting sources. Speaking includes the verbal and non-verbal communication of information and ideas to a variety of audiences in different situations for many different purposes. The center portion of the graphic represents the heart of the mission of the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts. The images of the books and tablet convey the idea that English language literacy is achieved through multiple media. The mortarboard on the map represents the goal of English language literacy for all Alabama graduates. The skills and knowledge represented in the conceptual framework of the Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts will prepare students to function as highly skilled communicators, critical thinkers, and effective problem-solvers. They will be able to meet the academic demands of elementary, middle, and high school and be prepared for further study and the workplace. Alabama students can achieve the goal of English language literacy. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 6",242
Page 18,"SYNOPSIS OF LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS Program Foundation The Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts provides the legal foundation for the minimum content of a locally adopted English Language Arts curriculum, as specified in the Code of Alabama, § 16-6B-2(f), Core curriculum. Using the Course of Study, school superintendents direct the selection, development, and implementation of curriculum for schools in their systems. Local boards of education approve this curriculum and make it available to each teacher and interested citizen. The state textbook adoption process for English Language Arts will begin after the Alabama State Board of Education adopts the 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts . Upon completion of the state textbook adoption process, local school districts have the opportunity to select resources to support instruction based on this course of study and the curriculum mandated by local boards. Program Implementation English Language Arts instruction is required in all grades, Kindergarten through Grade 12. A minimum of four credits in English Language Arts is required for high school graduation. Legal Foundations Dyslexia ADMINISTRATIVE CODE SUPP. (NO. 98-4) This is a measure to ensure that Alabama’s students with dyslexia are provided with early identification and dyslexia-specific intervention through general education in Alabama schools as part of the Problem Solving Team process.

Page 19,"English Learners (ELs) In Alabama an English Learner (EL) is an individual — (A) who is aged 3 through 21; (B) who is enrolled or preparing to enroll in an elementary school or secondary school; (C) (i) who was not born in the United States, or whose native language is a language other than English; (ii) (I) who is a Native American or Alaska Native, or a native resident of the outlying areas; and (II) who comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on the individual’s level of English language proficiency; or (iii) who is migratory, whose native language is a language other than English, and who comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant; and (D) whose difficulties in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language may be sufficient to deny the individual— (i) the ability to meet the challenging state academic standards; (ii) the ability to successfully achieve in classrooms where the language of instruction is English; or (iii) the opportunity to participate fully in society . Students whose first language is not English, designated as English Learners (ELs), are expected to “meet the (same) challenging State academic standards expected of all students” [ESEA section 1113(C)(i)(II)(cc)]. According to the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice (2015), “EL students are entitled to appropriate language assistance services to become proficient in English.” Each EL student is therefore entitled to instructional supports, scaffolds, and services that support him or her to meet grade-level standards and to participate meaningfully in the English Language Arts classroom while they acquire English. Lexi’s Law Act #2016-352 Lexi's Law requires cursive handwriting to be taught by the end of third grade in all state schools. Lexi's Law prescribes a standardized method for teaching cursive handwriting and provides classroom instruction plans outlining when and how cursive handwriting is to be taught. The Alabama Literacy Act #2019-523 The Alabama Legislature passed the Alabama Literacy Act [HB388], which became a law on June 10, 2019. This legislation, based on the best current research, provides comprehensive information and guidance for educators and requires concentrated, systematic efforts to improve the reading skills of all public school students so that every student is reading at or above grade-level by the end of Grade 3. The Alabama Literacy Act outlines steps to improve the reading proficiency of each student in Kindergarten through Grade 3 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 8",553
Page 20,"and ties the student’s progression from one grade to the next, in part, to his/her proficiency in reading. The legislation defines specific foundational skills to be taught and mastered in Alabama public schools. Problem Solving Teams (PST) . By August 15, 2011, all public schools in Alabama were required to implement the PST model. (a) Definitions. (1.) Problem Solving Teams (PST) is a model to guide general education intervention services for all students who have academic and/or behavioral difficulties. The PST is central to the school’s successful implementation of the Response to Instruction (RtI) framework. (2.) Response to Instruction (RtI) refers to an instructional framework that promotes a well-integrated system connecting general, gifted, supplemental, and special education services in providing high-quality, standards-based instruction and intervention that is matched to students’ academic, social-emotional, and behavioral needs. RtI combines core instruction, assessment, and intervention within a multi-tiered system to increase student achievement and reduce behavior problems. (b) Decisions regarding the number of PSTs needed by a school should be determined at the school level; however, a minimum of one PST per school is required to review data-based documentation regarding students’ progress regularly, advise teachers on specific interventions matched to student needs, and communicate with parents regarding interventions being provided. (c) The Problem Solving Teams will analyze the screening and progress-monitoring data to assist teachers in planning and implementing appropriate instruction and evidence-based interventions for all students with academic and/or behavioral dif ficulties, including those students who exhibit the characteristics of dyslexia. (d) The documentation requirements for a referral to special education are found in the Alabama Administrative Code, Chapter 290-8-9.01(2) and (4) (Child Identification) and Chapter 290-8- 9.03(10)(b)1, (10)(c)2.(ii), (10)(d)2.(I)(II)(ii) and (10)(d)4. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 9",447
Page 21,"POSITION STATEMENTS The 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts defines the minimum content in terms of what students should know or be able to do at the end of each course or grade. For these standards to be met, educators at district and school levels must engage with the standards and apply them to their own situations. Certain fundamental understandings are integral to this process of engagement and application. The committee formulated position statements to elaborate upon the standards and the expectations under which local education agencies should work as they select and/or write curriculum and other materials to implement the Course of Study . Defining Literacy Literacy encompasses the ability to identify , understand, interpret, create, communicate, and process information using printed and written materials in various contexts. The English Language Arts Course of Study approaches literacy in the context of two major categories, reception and expression. Reception refers to the ability to understand both spoken and written words through listening and reading. Reading instruction includes all components needed for students to read fluently and comprehend readily . In order to comprehend what they read and hear, students must master skills in the following foundational areas: phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency , vocabulary , oral language, and comprehension. Expression, the production of language either in spoken or written form, is accomplished through speaking and writing. Proficiency in expression includes both the use of correctly crafted sentences and the effective, expressive communication of ideas. To communicate successfully through written expression, students must master skills in the following foundational areas: phonological awareness, phonemic awareness, phonics, handwriting, encoding (spelling), and correct sentence formulation/or ganization, including punctuation, while also continuing to develop oral language, vocabulary , and topic knowledge. As students master the English Language Arts standards, they should also learn to conduct research using technology to access a variety of resources. Digital literacy instruction teaches students to locate and use information responsibly to become better readers, writers, and thinkers. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 10",411
Page 22,"The purpose of English Language Arts instruction is to develop English language literacy in all students, including the ability to listen, speak, read, and write fluently; to think critically; to solve problems independently; and to use digital resources responsibly. The ultimate goal of literacy instruction is to prepare students to utilize higher-order thinking skills, process information proficiently, and communicate effectively so they can meet opportunities and challenges, respond to the world around them, and impact the lives of others in beneficial and productive ways. Appreciation of Literature While creating fluent, accurate readers is vital, engendering a love for reading and an appreciation of literature is also an important goal. In Kindergarten through Grade 3, substantial amounts of classroom reading instruction should be devoted to teaching students to read. Explicit instruction in phonological awareness and phonics in the primary grades will provide the foundation for strong literacy skills. In later grades, when students are capable of reading the words, teachers can begin to focus on comprehension strategies such as summarizing, predicting, questioning, identifying main ideas, making inferences, identifying the author's purpose, and distinguishing fact from opinion. Direct instruction in evidence-based reading strategies does not distract from reading enjoyment; rather, it increases the pleasure that may be gained from reading literature. Students who are able to decode words and comprehend what they read should be encouraged to experience a variety of authentic texts and to select some of their own reading materials. In addition, opportunities should be provided for sufficient quantity and quality of reading to bring students into regular contact with new words, sentence structures, and paragraph and story structures, which will expand their reading abilities. To help students cultivate their love for reading and an appreciation of literature, teachers should allow readers to select some materials of particular interest to them. Such opportunities will build reading fluency and comprehension. Of course, self-selected reading materials are not intended to replace the challenging materials assigned for direct instruction. Diversity of Literacy English Language Arts instruction must include learning experiences which encompass critical, research, language, vocabulary, and digital literacies to provide a diverse foundation for reception and expression. Using different types of texts in digital and print formats promotes the diversity needed for a complete reading and writing experience. Texts that are inclusive of varied perspectives, backgrounds, and cultural influences should be available and used in the classroom. Diversity encompasses selecting disparate genres and various authors from an array of cultural, gender, and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Text selections should include varied character representations, topics or themes, settings, and situations that allow students to explore 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 11",525
Page 23,"and discover views and experiences which are different from their own. The use of diverse texts encourages students to examine their current ideas, promotes empathy for others, and nurtures a richer understanding of the world. Additionally , the formats of texts should represent all modern communication avenues and tools, which may vary greatly from traditional ways of communicating. The twenty-first-century student needs to be ready to function in a world of constantly evolving pathways for communication. To enable students to increase their ability to understand, evaluate, and foster a global society , English Language Arts teachers should use technology in support of learning and digital information in tandem with instruction to shape a diverse learning experience. Digital Literacy Students in the twenty-first century need to develop comprehensive skills to communicate effectively using digital technologies. Digital literacy can be defined as the ability to locate, understand, use, and compose information on different media platforms using various elements (images, sound, movement, words) shared through digital technologies. Digital literacy is not limited to the ability to use a computer or some other digital device; rather , it means students become critical users of technology who utilize the tools and modes of digital communication to reach audiences for the purpose and message of their own communication. Instruction in English Language Arts should aim to support the standards in the Alabama Course of Study: Digital Literacy and Computer Science and to produce digitally literate citizens by incorporating digital literacy skills in all areas. Students should be equipped to read and critique digital texts, find credible digital sources for their research, analyze and evaluate digital and multimedia texts, and compose and create texts in various formats, using all modes of communication. Digitally literate students are well prepared to join the workforce, with the knowledge, skills, and flexibility to perform daily , job-related tasks using a variety of current and emer ging technologies. In addition, digital literacy opens paths for exploration and enjoyment in the digital world. Literacy Integration in All Content Areas Reading in content areas is reading to acquire information in order to build conceptual knowledge, formulate and test hypotheses, explain how a solution was derived, and understand contexts and perspectives. As students explore texts in various subjects, they refine their skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Integrating academic literacy instruction into content area instruction increases the likelihood that students will make inferences, identify main ideas, learn vocabulary , link ideas across texts, and construct meaning from content-area texts. This is especially important for primary students as they build knowledge of the world around them. Primary-grades teachers should spend time reading 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 12",523
Page 24,"aloud, facilitating discussions, and building students’ background knowledge and vocabulary across all genres and content areas until the students themselves are fully capable of reading to learn in the content areas. Content from other subject areas should be integrated into English Language Arts instruction via collaboration among teachers from different areas. Integrating subject-area content leads to deeper understanding of concepts as students utilize the skills and practices of English Language Arts to investigate, consider, and utilize knowledge from other areas. Thematic and cross-curricular teaching encourage wider perspectives and broader understandings. The challenges of collaboration are richly compensated by the rewards experienced by students and teachers alike. Assessment of Literacy Assessment is an ongoing process of identifying students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to design instruction to meet their individual needs. Teachers should use both formative and summative assessments in the English Language Arts classroom. Formative assessment is the evaluation of learning through ongoing observation of students’ notes, questions, participation, assignment drafts, or journal entries. Teachers use formative assessments to modify their instructional strategies to help students achieve the desired learning outcomes. Summative assessments come at the end of an instructional unit to evaluate student learning in relation to a standard or benchmark. Whenever possible, teachers should assess student learning using authentic or performance-based activities that actively engage students. These authentic, performance-based assessments should be included in every facet of a language arts curriculum. Assessment of group work should focus on skills which are vital to real-world and workplace tasks such as problem-solving, interpersonal skills, and communicating through digital technologies. Differentiated Literacy Instruction Providing differentiated instruction for all students is essential to their academic growth. Alabama’s populations of English Learners, students in need of intensive intervention, and students with exceptional learning needs continue to increase. Alabama schools must implement effective practices to meet the diverse needs of students in all of these groups. In order to differentiate instruction appropriately, teachers must assess students using formative, summative, formal, and informal assessments, including benchmark and diagnostic assessments when appropriate. The data collected for each student will drive the design of classroom instruction, including identification of various areas where students require additional instruction. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 13",452
Page 25,"Students with Exceptional Learning Needs Students who receive special education services will benefit greatly from differentiated instruction in English Language Arts because foundational reading, fluency , and comprehension are essential for academic growth across all content areas. Collaboration between general education and special education teachers is essential in determining and meeting individual students’ needs. Teachers of these exceptional students must work together in implementing appropriate accommodations outlined in their Individualized Education Programs to ensure that students have equitable access to literacy across all content areas. Collaboration among teachers who instruct students with special needs ensures a positive working relationship among teachers, students, and families and provides seamless content instruction designed to meet the students’ unique learning needs. English Learners In recent years, Alabama has seen a significant increase in families and children whose first language is not English. These students, designated as English Learners (ELs), are in Alabama schools simultaneously acquiring academic English and mastering content standards. Their ability to learn content will be enhanced by appropriate differentiated instruction and accommodations in the classroom . English Learners face the double challenge of learning grade-level content in all areas while learning to speak, read, and write in English. Instructional supports and scaffolds for these students should enhance their language acquisition and reading development by promoting phonological/ phonemic awareness activities and develop their vocabularies by teaching them the structure of the English language through grammar and morphology instruction. Educators should consider factors such as age-appropriate academic development, English and home language proficiency , culture, and background knowledge when designing instruction that will develop lifelong readers, writers, and speakers of English. English Learners bring with them many resources that enhance their education. Many English Learners have first-language and literacy knowledge and skills that boost their acquisition of language and literacy in a second language. In addition, they may bring talents, cultural practices, and perspectives that can enrich our schools and society . Teachers must draw from this enormous reservoir of talent while providing additional time and appropriate instructional supports for students who need them. Professional Literacy Teachers Professional educators should be lifelong learners dedicated to improving their craft for the benefit of their students. Educators must hold themselves and their colleagues accountable for seeking and engaging in professional growth to improve their practice. Training in literacy instruction must be at the forefront of professional learning in all grade levels. Furthermore, the Alabama Literacy Act requires that teachers in Kinder garten through Grade 3 receive training in the science of reading. Because the science of reading is 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 14",504
Page 26,"integrated into the course of study, teachers must embrace professional learning to become thoroughly familiar with its terminology and principles so they can understand the intent of the standards and implement them fully. Two vital elements of professional growth are interaction with other professionals in the local community and active participation in state and national English Language Arts organizations. In addition, teachers must also fulfill the professional responsibility of promoting proficiency in English Language Arts as a meaningful endeavor which is applicable to everyday life. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 15",105
Page 27,"DIRECTIONS FOR INTERPRETING CONTENT STANDARDS The illustrations below are guides for interpreting the Grades K-12 minimum required content outlining what students should know and be able to do at the end of a grade or course. Standards are grouped by grade band: K-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-8, and 9-12. Grades within each group share content areas and subareas, focus areas of reception and expression, and categories of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Grades within each band will also share recurring standards. Secondary grades add literacy types: critical, research, language, vocabulary , and digital literacies. Recurring Standards for English Language Arts are an important part of each grade level. For each grade band, a list of Recurring Standards for English Language Arts has been created to focus on integral content which must be taught in each grade within the band. These standards are to be embedded in daily instruction. Because content increases in rigor throughout the Course of Study , the recurring standards change from one grade band to the next, reflecting the increasing scope and complexity of the scaffolded content.

Page 33,"GRADES K-3 OVERVIEW In Kinder garten through Grade 3, the standards focus on essential foundational skills needed to support literacy development. Standards are written in a way that promotes direct, explicit, systematic, sequential, and cumulative instruction with extensive practice in these essential foundational skills: oral language, concepts of print, phonological and phonemic awareness, phonics (decoding), fluency , vocabulary , comprehension, and writing (including encoding). Reading standards, which incorporate reading and responding to multiple types of texts in various ways, start in Kinder garten and continue throughout the grades. Grades K-3 standards encompass all components of grade-appropriate proficient reading, from decoding words to adding literacy knowledge, building and accessing background knowledge, understanding language structures, and using verbal reasoning. Standards for Grades K-3 are explicit, rigorous, and comprehensive, providing structures to scaffold reading and writing development from simple to more complex skills within and across the grade levels. This level of specificity is essential for students to learn the phonemic awareness and phonics skills they need to become successful readers and writers. Standards emphasize the practice of writing in many forms, which promotes growth in language arts. The writing process begins with the speech-to-print connection at the phoneme level and grade-appropriate assignments in Kinder garten, then progresses through increasingly more comprehensive and challenging assignments in subsequent grades. Students learn to express their thoughts effectively in a variety of formats and situations and to assess and improve their own written work. The development of the K-3 standards was guided by the science of reading, which is the body of research that has emer ged from multiple disciplines (including cognitive psychology , neuroscience, and linguistics) to discover how the brain learns to read and write and why some students experience difficulty doing so. The Simple View of Reading (Gough and Tunmer) and the Simple View of Writing (Berninger et al.), Scarborough’ s Reading Rope , and Ehri’ s Phases of Word Reading Development are only a few examples of the models that guided the development of the Grades K-3 standards. All standards align with and fully support all requirements of the Alabama Literacy Act and are written in a way that will help classroom teachers, special education teachers, and EL teachers identify students’ lowest level deficit skill(s) and differentiate instruction to meet students’ individual needs. While prescribing the minimum standards for Grades K-3 English Language Arts, the standards in this document also represent content that promotes high expectations and defines high levels of literacy acquisition for all students in Alabama. The standards outline what a student should know and be able to do at the end of each grade level. Categories will change from one grade level to the next as readers become more proficient in mastering foundational skills throughout each grade level. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 22",583
Page 34,"An effective instructional program will capitalize on the interrelated nature of the standards and connect content in ways that allow standards to be taught simultaneously . For example, aligning phonemic awareness, decoding, fluency , and encoding standards according to skills being taught allows students to focus on specific patterns and progressions as they practice identifying phonemes, decoding, encoding, and working on fluency . For each grade band, a list of Recurring Standards for English Language Arts has been created to focus on integral content which must be taught in each grade within the band. These standards are to be embedded in daily instruction. Because content increases in rigor throughout the Course of Study , the recurring standards change from one grade band to the next, reflecting the increasing scope and complexity of the scaffolded content.

Page 54,"Grade 2 GRADE 2 In Grade 2, Literacy Foundations continue to be essential as a basis for increased proficiency and a bridge to higher levels of instruction. Specificity in the standards remains to develop the needed phonemic awareness and phonics skills to become successful readers and writers. The categories Reading, Listening, Writing, and Speaking have been added to the organization of the standards as students are becoming more proficient in mastering foundational skills. Not every content area will have a standard in every category . In such cases, the category remains blank with the row shaded to indicate that the omission was intentional. The writing process is integrated throughout the standards as a key to expressive learning. In accordance with the Simple View of Writing (Berninger et al.), foundational writing skills remain in the Literacy Foundations (standards 37-39); however , the written composition skills transition to the Written Expression category in standards 40-46 as students begin using the stages of the writing process more independently to produce narrative, informative, and opinion writings in response to texts. These tasks become more demanding as rigor increases from second to third grade. The K-3 Recurring Standards for English Language Arts, shown in the chart below , are an important part of every grade level. Through these standards, students learn and practice active listening, utilize word-analysis skills, build background knowledge and vocabulary skills, learn and practice essential digital skills, and utilize a process to create and modify written work.

Page 77,"GRADES 4-5 OVERVIEW In Grades 4 and 5, students continue to grow as readers, writers, listeners, and speakers. They are still concrete learners, but they are beginning to delve into abstract thinking. Collaboration with peers and instructors is critical in these grades as students learn to develop ideas by drawing upon the insight of others. Literacy growth and development are fostered by direct, explicit reading instruction which is built on foundational literacy skills and on regular formative assessments. Inquiry- and discovery-based learning environments draw upon the natural curiosity of fourth and fifth grade students, encouraging their engagement, creating deeper understanding, and forging a more personal connection to what they read, write, speak, and hear. Although Foundational Literacy headings are not used in Grades 4 and 5, students continue to develop foundational skills, building on the alphabetic principle, comprehension and encoding, fluency , phonemic awareness, phonics, phonological awareness, and vocabulary foundations laid in Grades K-3 in accordance with the Alabama Literacy Act. In Grades 4 and 5, standards are elevated to ensure continuous student mastery appropriate for upper elementary proficient readers. Students extend learning from concrete ideas to abstract concepts. When students exhibit deficits in foundational skills, teachers should refer to the companion resources that will be published to support the course of study and to school and district RtI and intervention plans. Reading standards in Grades 4 and 5 continue to be a major component of receptive content instruction. Reading skills, developed with equal focus on fiction and informational text, allow students to comprehend relationships, author interpretations, events, procedures, ideas, and concepts across content areas. Instruction should provide opportunities for students to read widely and deeply from a broad range of high-quality , rigorous literary and informational texts in order to build the confidence and background knowledge needed for a solid reading foundation. Students can build this solid foundation when instruction is intentionally and coherently structured to develop rich content knowledge within and across grades. The writing process is integrated throughout the standards in Grades 4 and 5 as a major impetus to expressive learning. The Simple View of Writing (Berninger et al.) was a guiding factor in development of these standards. In order for students to become proficient writers, they must possess foundational writing skills to encode and organize words and composition skills to formulate and organize content. Students use the stages of the writing process to meet the challenging expectations of the standards by producing narrative, informative, and argumentative writings in response to many types of texts. These tasks become more demanding as rigor increases from fourth to fifth grade. Focusing on language and grammar skills during the writing process embeds language learning into 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 66",552
Page 78,"meaningful practice. The inclusion of keyboarding and handwriting techniques during writing enhances clear expression and production of work. Short research projects combine aspects of reading and writing to produce comprehensive, abstract work. Conventions of standard English (including relative pronouns, verb forms, prepositional phrases, and appropriate capitalization and punctuation) and general academic and domain-specific vocabulary continue to be critical components in language development that students apply to reading, speaking, and listening as well as to writing. Listening and speaking skills enhance learning for both reception and expression for students in Grades 4 and 5. Through discussion, collaboration, and reporting, students learn to be productive participants in conversations that require them to compare, contrast, analyze, and synthesize a multitude of ideas in various domains. Technology is used to enhance and expand both reception and expression, allowing students to transcend traditional learning environments by accessing and communicating information virtually . When “including” appears in content standards, it should be construed as “including but not limited to.” The items listed must be taught; others may also be included in instruction. Examples represent options that might prove useful in instruction of the standard. They are not intended to be exhaustive lists and the suggestions listed do not have to be taught.

While students still ask and answer questions about literary and informational texts, they increasingly perform these tasks mentally (“thinking about their thinking”) and usually write their responses instead of expressing them aloud. Students who still struggle with oral language, phonological awareness, and phonemic awareness should receive intervention and/or individualized instruction to close those gaps and to develop the expertise needed for reading and interpreting more complex literary works. The focus areas Reception and Expression are now listed alongside the categories of Reading, Listening, Writing, and Speaking, indicating the alignment of each area with the categories’ primary goals: reception of ideas with the Reading and Listening categories, and expression of ideas with the Writing and Listening categories.

Page 96,"GRADES 6-8 OVERVIEW Students in the middle grades under go physical, social, emotional, and intellectual changes that affect their daily learning experiences. Individuals progress from pre-adolescence to adolescence at vastly different rates. This process is neither sequential nor predictable and often includes periods of fluctuation between adolescence and pre-adolescence. While middle school students are sensitive to the opinions of peers, they are beginning to assert their independence when dealing with adults. Although some students are just beginning to navigate the digital world and understand their place in it, many are already proficient. Regardless of skill level, all students must continue to grow in their digital knowledge as our world continues to change. Like students in earlier grades, middle school students engage through diverse learning styles and require differentiation in both instruction and assessment to reach their potential. They have varied interests, and their skill levels differ. Middle grades students thrive in collaborative groups, both heterogeneous and homogeneous. Heavy emphasis is placed on the sharing of ideas with supporting evidence in pairs, small groups, and in larger settings. As they move from concrete thinking to abstract concepts, middle school students increasingly question others’ messages and points of view and enhance their ability to express and justify their own. To acknowledge this transition in thinking, standards in the middle grades also transition from the earlier grades’ explicit focus on building foundational literacy skills (with concurrent emphasis on reading and writing) to the application of foundational skills and knowledge to read and respond to various types of literature. Students transition to fully applying those skills in a literacy environment. The Course of Study for Grades 6-8 marks this progression by organizing standards into types of literacy (critical, digital, language, research, and vocabulary). An overarching concept at the beginning of each type focuses on its central task. These overarching concepts are the same in each grade from six through twelve. Middle school learners are eager and filled with curiosity on a more analytical level. Thus, the world of reading expands for middle school students. Reading becomes more holistic and profound in subject matter . Sources of reading span all subject areas, cultures, and formats as students begin to recognize the interconnectedness of their world. These texts also become sources for research. Students in the middle level begin to discern the validity and credibility of information, as well as the importance of employing that discernment in today’ s world. Students also learn the importance of citing their sources to acknowledge the work of other academics and to build their own credibility as researchers and writers. Writing in the middle grades becomes more rigorous as the emphasis on organization and textual evidence becomes a daily requirement. Writing is fostered and sustained by both shorter pieces of writing and longer , more challenging works. Students in Grades 6-8 hone their vocabulary literacy by paying attention to connotative meanings, understanding their audience, and expanding 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 85",583
Page 97,"their academic and domain-specific vocabulary . They also continue to develop their language and grammar skills as they review foundational knowledge and build upon it with new concepts in their writing, reading, listening, and speaking. Grades 6-8 standards are designed to build a solid foundation as students transition to advanced competencies in Grades 9-12 . The rigor and the depth of knowledge required in the standards gradually increase through the grades to prepare students for the challenges of high school work. Notes on instruction: When “including” appears in content standards, it should be construed as “including but not limited to.” The items listed must be taught; others may also be included in instruction. Examples represent options that might prove useful in instruction of the standard. They are not intended to be exhaustive lists and the suggestions listed are not required to be taught. Some standards are very close in meaning across the middle school grades. It is expected that rigor will be increased by selecting more challenging literature and requiring more advanced writing in successive grades. Grade 6-8 Recurring Standards for English Language Arts, listed at the beginning of each grade level, are to be fully included in instruction. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 86",252

Page 119,"GRADES 9-12 OVERVIEW In Grades 9-12, a rigorous and successful high school English Language Arts program challenges students to integrate literacy skills in order to complete complex tasks and create sophisticated products. While life goals differ from one student to another , it remains incumbent upon high schools to provide instruction that enables all of them to develop the skills for meeting the demands of the twenty-first century . To that end, this course of study provides standards that address literacy as the integration of skills and allow the robust exchange and application of ideas. Literacy involves the reception and expression of ideas in many contexts for many purposes. High school students are mature learners who can proficiently read and write individually and in group settings; they are mastering abstract thought, refining self-monitoring skills, and developing listening and speaking skills so they can receive and express ideas clearly , appropriately , and productively . Engagement with digital resources and the creation of digital products are essential for high school students. Abstract thinking allows them to discern purpose and to draw conclusions about the value of the ideas expressed and the effectiveness of the media, rhetorical, and aesthetic techniques used. At this age, students are equipped to consider and generate opposing points of view , pose questions, and make decisions about the most effective ways to present ideas. They are capable of determining the quality and credibility of sources, synthesizing information, and giving appropriate credit. Accurately conveying the ideas of others in appropriate contexts and working with others to select and present information in the most effective way are the hallmarks of skilled communicators. While working with others, students learn to accept revision and augmentation of their ideas, respond constructively to the ideas of others, and accept that not all the ideas proposed will appear in a finished product. Students advocate for their own ideas while being receptive to those of others. The high school standards are written to encourage student access to sophisticated ideas and techniques within complex and diverse literary works. With diversity in mind, Alabama Course of Study standards emphasize the literature of varied times and places. Both ninth and tenth grade standards emphasize world literature to give students a broad and deep foundation for the primary focus on American literature in the eleventh grade and British literature in the twelfth grade. While standards for Grades 9 and 10 emphasize literature outside the United States and the British Isles, they do not preclude teaching American or British works. Local education agencies may choose to incorporate American or British works alongside those from other areas in order to create thematic units or to provide comparison and contrast among authors, literary genres and forms, subjects, points of view , purposes, or writing styles. The literature of America before, during, and after European arrival warrants a year of specific attention because of literature’ s deep ties to all aspects of culture, and its study encourages a cross-curricular understanding and appreciation of qualities that distinguish 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 108",589
Page 120,"American literature specifically and American culture in general. A year of focus on the literature of the British Isles provides both a linguistic and cultural starting point that more fully contextualizes the eventual forming of the United States and informs a sophisticated understanding of the connections between American and British literature contrasted with the unique character of each. Even though each grade level features a specific area of literary emphasis, the unequalled literary contributions of William Shakespeare justify the inclusion of study of a Shakespeare play in every year of high school. Shakespeare’ s dramatic works provide an unparalleled opportunity to see the interplay of sophisticated themes and masterful linguistic techniques. His plays further occupy a unique and important position as cultural and aesthetic touchstones. A Shakespeare play is required in Grade 12, and Shakespeare's poetry and plays are strongly recommended in Grades 9-11. It is also suggested that a work by another master playwright be included each year, drawing from a wide range of cultures and times from ancient Greece and Asia to the present. Standards are designed to equip students to discern purpose (including recognizing irony and satire), understand the importance of aesthetic decisions by the author , and note how choices of syntax and diction shape and clarify meaning. Local school districts are encouraged to select a curriculum which includes challenging texts representing various time periods, places, and cultural and philosophical perspectives and to support students as they learn to adapt fluidly to multiple nonfiction, informational, and technical texts with varying degrees of complexity in order to determine purpose and use information effectively . Finally , standards are organized under types of literacy (critical, digital, language, and research) to reflect the applications of literacy in a rapidly changing world. This format represents an effort to show that successful communication requires multifaceted receptive and expressive skills. The organizing groups are not to be construed as educational units, nor should standards only be taught within a particular focus area. Instead, the groupings illustrate the interconnected nature of all communication skills. Each heading is followed by an explanation of its overarching concept, which is the same in each grade. Notes on instruction: ●When “including” appears in standards, it should be construed as “including but not limited to.” The items listed must be taught; others may also be included in instruction. ●Examples present options that might prove useful in instruction of the standard. They are not intended to be exhaustive lists and the suggestions listed are not required to be taught. ●When a standard specifies writing or speaking “suitable for an authentic audience,” it does not require that the writing or speech must actually be presented to such an audience. ●Some standards are very close in meaning in Grades 9 and 10 and in Grades 11 and 12. It is expected that rigor will be increased by selecting more challenging literature in successive grades. 2021 Alabama Course of Study: English Language Arts 109",575
